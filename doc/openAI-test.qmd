## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(openai)
library(jpeg)
pic <- openai::create_image("dog playing with a hot dog")
image_url <- pic$data$url
image <- readJPEG(image_url)
```

![image](pic$data$url)



You can add options to executable code like this


The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
